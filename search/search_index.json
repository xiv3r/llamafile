Mozilla.ai recently adopted the llamafile project, and we're planning an approach for codebase modernization.

Read more via the blog and add your voice to the discussion here.</p> <p> </p> <p></p> <p>llamafile lets you distribute and run LLMs with a single file. (announcement blog post)</p> <p>Our goal is to make open LLMs much more accessible to both developers and end users. We're doing that by combining llama.cpp with Cosmopolitan Libc into one framework that collapses all the complexity of LLMs down to a single-file executable (called a \"llamafile\") that runs locally on most computers, with no installation.</p> <p> llamafile is a Mozilla Builders project.</p>"},{"location":"#how-llamafile-works","title":"How llamafile works","text":"<p>A llamafile is an executable LLM that you can run on your own computer. It contains the weights for a given open LLM, as well as everything needed to actually run that model on your computer. There's nothing to install or configure (with a few caveats, discussed in subsequent sections of this document).</p> <p>This is all accomplished by combining llama.cpp with Cosmopolitan Libc, which provides some useful capabilities:</p> <ol> <li> <p>llamafiles can run on multiple CPU microarchitectures. We added runtime dispatching to llama.cpp that lets new Intel systems use modern CPU features without trading away support for older computers.</p> </li> <li> <p>llamafiles can run on multiple CPU architectures. We do that by concatenating AMD64 and ARM64 builds with a shell script that launches the appropriate one. Our file format is compatible with WIN32 and most UNIX shells. It's also able to be easily converted (by either you or your users) to the platform-native format, whenever required.</p> </li> <li> <p>llamafiles can run on six OSes (macOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD). If you make your own llama files, you'll only need to build your code once, using a Linux-style toolchain. The GCC-based compiler we provide is itself an Actually Portable Executable, so you can build your software for all six OSes from the comfort of whichever one you prefer most for development.</p> </li> <li> <p>The weights for an LLM can be embedded within the llamafile. We added support for PKZIP to the GGML library. This lets uncompressed weights be mapped directly into memory, similar to a self-extracting archive. It enables quantized weights distributed online to be prefixed with a compatible version of the llama.cpp software, thereby ensuring its originally observed behaviors can be reproduced indefinitely.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, with the tools included in this project you can create your own llamafiles, using any compatible model weights you want. You can then distribute these llamafiles to other people, who can easily make use of them regardless of what kind of computer they have.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"#licensing","title":"Licensing","text":"<p>While the llamafile project is Apache 2.0-licensed, our changes to llama.cpp are licensed under MIT (just like the llama.cpp project itself) so as to remain compatible and upstreamable in the future, should that be desired.</p> <p>The llamafile logo on this page was generated with the assistance of DALL\u00b7E 3.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"creating_llamafiles/","title":"Creating llamafiles","text":"<p>If you want to be able to just say:</p> <pre><code>./llava.llamafile\n</code></pre> <p>...and have it run the web server without having to specify arguments, then you can embed both the weights and a special <code>.args</code> inside, which specifies the default arguments.

This is a one time cost that happens the first time you run your llamafile. The DSO built by llamafile is stored in <code>$TMPDIR/.llamafile</code> or <code>$HOME/.llamafile</code>. Offloading to GPU is enabled by default when a Metal GPU is present. This can be disabled by passing <code>-ngl 0</code> or <code>--gpu disable</code> to force llamafile to perform CPU inference.</p> <p>Owners of NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards need to pass the <code>-ngl 999</code> flag to enable maximum offloading. If multiple GPUs are present then the work will be divided evenly among them by default, so you can load larger models. Multiple GPU support may be broken on AMD Radeon systems. If that happens to you, then use <code>export HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0</code> which forces llamafile to only use the first GPU.</p> <p>Windows users are encouraged to use our release binaries, because they contain prebuilt DLLs for both NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards, which only depend on the graphics driver being installed. If llamafile detects that NVIDIA's CUDA SDK or AMD's ROCm HIP SDK are installed, then llamafile will try to build a faster DLL that uses cuBLAS or rocBLAS. In order for llamafile to successfully build a cuBLAS module, it needs to be run on the x64 MSVC command prompt. You can use CUDA via WSL by enabling Nvidia CUDA on WSL and running your llamafiles inside of WSL. Using WSL has the added benefit of letting you run llamafiles greater than 4GB on Windows.</p> <p>On Linux, NVIDIA users will need to install the CUDA SDK (ideally using the shell script installer) and ROCm users need to install the HIP SDK.

The long story short is llamafile is a shell script that launches itself and runs inference on embedded weights in milliseconds without needing to be copied or installed. What makes that possible is mmap(). Both the llama.cpp executable and the weights are concatenated onto the shell script. A tiny loader program is then extracted by the shell script, which maps the executable into memory. The llama.cpp executable then opens the shell script again as a file, and calls mmap() again to pull the weights into memory and make them directly accessible to both the CPU and GPU.</p>"},{"location":"technical_details/#zip-weights-embedding","title":"ZIP weights embedding","text":"<p>The trick to embedding weights inside llama.cpp executables is to ensure the local file is aligned on a page size boundary. That way, assuming the zip file is uncompressed, once it's mmap()'d into memory we can pass pointers directly to GPUs like Apple Metal, which require that data be page size aligned. Since no existing ZIP archiving tool has an alignment flag, we had to write about 500 lines of code to insert the ZIP files ourselves. However, once there, every existing ZIP program should be able to read them, provided they support ZIP64. This makes the weights much more easily accessible than they otherwise would have been, had we invented our own file format for concatenated files.</p>"},{"location":"technical_details/#microarchitectural-portability","title":"Microarchitectural portability","text":"<p>On Intel and AMD microprocessors, llama.cpp spends most of its time in the matmul quants, which are usually written thrice for SSSE3, AVX, and AVX2. llamafile pulls each of these functions out into a separate file that can be <code>#include</code>ed multiple times, with varying <code>__attribute__((__target__(\"arch\")))</code> function attributes. Then, a wrapper function is added which uses Cosmopolitan's <code>X86_HAVE(FOO)</code> feature to runtime dispatch to the appropriate implementation.</p>"},{"location":"technical_details/#architecture-portability","title":"Architecture portability","text":"<p>llamafile solves architecture portability by building llama.cpp twice: once for AMD64 and again for ARM64. It then wraps them with a shell script which has an MZ prefix. On Windows, it'll run as a native binary. On Linux, it'll extract a small 8kb executable called APE Loader to <code>${TMPDIR:-${HOME:-.}}/.ape</code> that'll map the binary portions of the shell script into memory. It's possible to avoid this process by running the <code>assimilate</code> program that comes included with the <code>cosmocc</code> compiler. What the <code>assimilate</code> program does is turn the shell script executable into the host platform's native executable format. This guarantees a fallback path exists for traditional release processes when it's needed.</p>"},{"location":"technical_details/#gpu-support","title":"GPU support","text":"<p>Cosmopolitan Libc uses static linking, since that's the only way to get the same executable to run on six OSes. This presents a challenge for llama.cpp, because it's not possible to statically link GPU support. The way we solve that is by checking if a compiler is installed on the host system. For Apple, that would be Xcode, and for other platforms, that would be <code>nvcc</code>. llama.cpp has a single file implementation of each GPU module, named <code>ggml-metal.m</code> (Objective C) and <code>ggml-cuda.cu</code> (Nvidia C). llamafile embeds those source files within the zip archive and asks the platform compiler to build them at runtime, targeting the native GPU microarchitecture. If it works, then it's linked with platform C library dlopen() implementation. See llamafile/cuda.c and llamafile/metal.c.</p> <p>In order to use the platform-specific dlopen() function, we need to ask the platform-specific compiler to build a small executable that exposes these interfaces. On ELF platforms, Cosmopolitan Libc maps this helper executable into memory along with the platform's ELF interpreter. The platform C library then takes care of linking all the GPU libraries, and then runs the helper program which longjmp()'s back into Cosmopolitan. The executable program is now in a weird hybrid state where two separate C libraries exist which have different ABIs. For example, thread local storage works differently on each operating system, and programs will crash if the TLS register doesn't point to the appropriate memory. The way Cosmopolitan Libc solves that on AMD is by using SSE to recompile the executable at runtime to change <code>%fs</code> register accesses into <code>%gs</code> which takes a millisecond. On ARM, Cosmo uses the <code>x28</code> register for TLS which can be made safe by passing the <code>-ffixed-x28</code> flag when compiling GPU modules. Lastly, llamafile uses the <code>__ms_abi__</code> attribute so that function pointers passed between the application and GPU modules conform to the Windows calling convention. Amazingly enough, every compiler we tested, including nvcc on Linux and even Objective-C on MacOS, all support compiling WIN32 style functions, thus ensuring your llamafile will be able to talk to Windows drivers, when it's run on Windows, without needing to be recompiled as a separate file for Windows.
