# Built-in local tools

As llamafile relies on llama.cpp's code, it also inherits its built-in tools
for agentic usage.
**llama.cpp's built-in tools are experimental**, and can change between
releases. Currently they are primarily intended for the bundled Web UI,
though any custom agent loop can use them too.

The Web UI oversees the following:

- making the enabled tool definitions available to the model
- asking for permission before executing any requested tool
- running the tool through the server
- sending the result back to the model

The regular chat completion API does not automatically execute arbitrary tool
calls.

> [!WARNING]
> Built-in tools act with the operating-system permissions of the llamafile
> process. Some can read or modify local files or execute arbitrary commands.
> They are disabled by default. Enable only the tools you need, and avoid
> exposing a tool-enabled server to an untrusted network.

## Enable built-in tools

Pass `--tools` in server mode. Use `all` to enable every built-in tool, or a
comma-separated list to enable selected tools (see the complete list below):

```sh
# Enable every built-in tool
llamafile -m model.gguf --server --tools all

# Enable a read-only subset
llamafile -m model.gguf --server \
  --tools read_file,file_glob_search,grep_search,get_datetime
```

For a model-bundled llamafile, use its filename in place of `llamafile -m
model.gguf`:

```sh
./ModelName.llamafile --server --tools read_file,grep_search
```

Open the Web UI at <http://localhost:8080/> after the model loads.

Note: `--agent` enables all built-in tools and the experimental MCP proxy. Prefer
`--tools` when you only need local tools, because it exposes a smaller surface.

## Available tools

| Tool | Access | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read_file` | Read | Read all or part of a file. |
| `file_glob_search` | Read | Find files whose paths match a glob. |
| `grep_search` | Read | Search files for matching text. |
| `exec_shell_command` | Execute | Run a host shell command. |
| `write_file` | Write | Create or replace a file. |
| `edit_file` | Write | Replace selected text in an existing file. |
| `get_datetime` | Read | Get the server's current date and time. |
| `get_info` | Read | Get the runtime operating system and working directory. |

Tool support in llama.cpp is experimental and subject to change, so the contents
of this table might differ from one llamafile version to another. To inspect the
exact tool definitions and parameter signatures exposed by a running server,
call `GET /tools`:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/tools
```

The `/tools` endpoint is affected by all [API-related parameters](api.md).
If the server was started with `--api-prefix`, prepend that prefix here too.
When `--api-key` or `--api-key-file` is configured, you'll need to authenticate
your requests too.

## Security and sandbox behavior

Built-in tools are not a separate security boundary. Once they are enabled, any
client that can reach `/tools` and satisfy any configured API key can invoke an
enabled tool directly. The Web UI permission prompt is part of the interactive
browser flow, not server-side authorization.

Unless `--cors-origins` is set explicitly, enabling built-in tools changes the
allowed browser origin from `*` to localhost. Rembember, though, that CORS affects
browser access only and it should not be used instead of authentication.
As a general rule, expose the server to no more clients than necessary. Keep
the default loopback binding when possible, and configure `--api-key` before
making a tool-enabled server reachable from another machine. For the broader
sandbox model, see [Security](security.md).

llamafile's sandbox adds another layer of security, changing which tools can succeed:

| Runtime mode | Effect on built-in tools |
| --- | --- |
| CPU-only `--server` on Linux or OpenBSD | The default sandbox permits reads but blocks file writes, process creation, and command execution, so `write_file`, `edit_file`, and `exec_shell_command` fail. |
| CPU-only `--server --confine-reads` | The same restrictions apply, and reads are limited to the executable and configured model, adapter, media, and static-file directories. |
| GPU server | The sandbox is skipped because GPU drivers need system access that the sandbox cannot allow. Enabled tools run with the process's normal permissions. |
| Default combined TUI and server mode | The sandbox is skipped because the in-process TUI needs an HTTP client connection. |
| `--unsecure` or an operating system without supported sandboxing | The sandbox is disabled or unavailable, so enabled tools run with the process's normal permissions. |

Enabling tools in an otherwise sandboxed server relaxes the network restriction
so the server can make outbound connections, but it does not add permission to
write files or execute programs.

## Use with API clients

The OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions and Responses APIs and the
Anthropic-compatible Messages API can ask a model to call tools, but clients
still execute those calls and return the results. See [API server: Tool
calling](api.md#tool-calling).

## Internal `/tools` API

The bundled Web UI uses `GET /tools` to discover tool definitions and `POST
/tools` to invoke them. This interface is experimental and intended primarily
for the Web UI, not as a stable downstream application API. Most users should
let the Web UI or another agent loop call it rather than invoking it manually.

If no built-in or MCP tools are enabled, `GET /tools` and `POST /tools` return
HTTP `403`.
